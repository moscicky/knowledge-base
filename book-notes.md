## Software Craftsman \(PL 2015\)

You are in charge of your own career. Continuous development and willingness to learn are your tasks and should be your habit, not your employer order _62-65_

Read a lot of books. Focus on those about behaviour and classics like DDD and Design Patterns. While it may take years to gather the knowledge they contain, they will be relevant for years as opposed to books about concrete technology _66-67_

Practice makes perfect. Consider pet projects when learning new technologies and ideas like TDD. Practical application will help you master it quicker _70-73_ 

Practice pair programming. It will help you write cleaner code, improve your design process. You may also learn things that you wouldn't learn on your own _74-75_

Manage your time efficiently. Ditch long hours on youtube and social media. Always have something to read with you, read it when commuting, before sleep _75-78_

Follow Extreme Programming \(XP\) principles. TDD helps you design application structure better. Continuous integration means saving time in the future.  Pair programming gives you faster feedback than PR review. Refactoring = easier maintenance for others. _110-120_
