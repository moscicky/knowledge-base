## Personal opinion

I've always enjoyed Java and thought of it as high level C++. Some people say that Java is not modern enough for todays development. However I feel like _recent_ changes to the language in &gt; Java 8 and movement towards more functional approach made things a whole lot better and I don't think we will say _goodbye_ to java any time soon.
